Alignment files from Ynesmexia: a novel genus of cheilanthoid ferns by Blake D. Fauskee, Michael D. Windham, and Kathleen M. Pryer

This repo contains four ailgnment files. Three are from chloroplast genes and contain many other cheilanthoid ferns. The other contains almost exclusively members of Ynesmexia

All alignment files are in the alignment directory.
